Suez (Arabic: السويس as-Suways; Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [esseˈweːs]) is a seaport city (population of about 750,000 as of August 2018) in north-eastern Egypt, located on the north coast of the Gulf of Suez (a branch of the Red Sea), near the southern terminus of the Suez Canal, having the same boundaries as Suez Governorate. It has three harbours, Adabiya, Ain Sokhna and Port Tawfiq, and extensive port facilities. Together they form a metropolitan area, located mostly in Africa with a small portion in Asia.
Railway lines and highways connect the city with Cairo, Port Said, and Ismailia.  Suez has a petrochemical plant, and its oil refineries have pipelines carrying the finished product to Cairo. These are represented in the flag of the governorate: the blue background refers to the sea, the gear refers to Suez's status as an industrial governorate, and the flame refers to the petroleum firms of Suez.
The modern city of Suez is a successor of the ancient city of Clysma (Ancient Greek: Κλῦσμα, romanized: Klŷsma, meaning "surf, waves that break"; Coptic: ⲡⲉⲕⲗⲟⲩⲥⲙⲁ, romanized: Peklousma; Arabic: القلزم, romanized: al-Qulzum), the major Red Sea port and a center of monasticism.
