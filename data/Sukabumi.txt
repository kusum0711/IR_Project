Sukabumi (Sundanese: ᮞᮥᮊᮘᮥᮙᮤ) is a landlocked city surrounded by the regency of the same name (enclave) in the southern foothills of Mount Gede, in West Java, Indonesia, about 100 km (62 mi) south of the national capital, Jakarta.
At an altitude of approximately 584 m (1,916 ft), the city is a minor hill station resort, with a cooler climate than the surrounding lowlands. The area around Sukabumi is also a popular destination for whitewater rafting. Tea and Rubber production is a major industry in the area.  The suburban area surrounding Sukabumi circling the mountain has grown tremendously in population, such that northern Sukabumi Regency, hugging the volcano, and bordering Greater Jakarta, is home to the bulk of the regency's population.  The area of the city is 48.33 km2, and the population at the 2010 Census was 300,359, while the 2020 Census was 346,325. However, some 1.8 million people, as of the 2010 census figures, live in the surrounding metropolitan area.  The bulk of the metro area population is unusual in that it forms a narrow southwest ring around Mount Gede.  The eastern portion of the ringed population belt continues on to Cianjur Regency.
