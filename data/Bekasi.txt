Bekasi is one of the oldest cities in Indonesia, and has a history of being the capital city of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara. At that time, the name of Bekasi was Dayeuh Sundasembawa. The earliest evidence of its existence dates from the 5th century according to the Tugu inscription. During the Dutch East Indies period, Bekasi was a part of Batavia residency. As a dormitory city, many middle-up satellite areas have been developed in Bekasi, complete with their own shopping malls, schools, hospitals, club houses, water park, and shuttle bus services to central Jakarta. The large number of multinational companies, has apparently attracted many expatriates (mainly Japanese and Korean) to settle in Bekasi.
