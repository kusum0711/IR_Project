Randburg is an upmarket area located in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Formerly a separate municipality, its administration devolved to the newly created City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, along with neighbouring Sandton and Roodepoort, in the late 1990s. During the transitional period of 1996â€“2000, Randburg was part of the Northern Metropolitan Local Council (MLC).
